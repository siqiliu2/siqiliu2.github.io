I am a second-year master's student in the College of IST at Penn State University, where I have the privilege of being a part of the Wellbeing and Health Innovation Lab, advised by Dr. Saeed Abdullah. My primary focus lies in Human-Computer Interaction within the health domain, and I am currently involved in a project called REMI. This project explores how generative AI can assist in creating health intervention messages for individuals requiring palliative care.

Before joining IST, I worked for two years as a rehabilitation equipment analyst at Buffalo Intelligent Rehabilitation in Chengdu, China. There, I was responsible for transforming and processing data to ensure the completeness and validity of health records. I earned my B.S. degree from Sichuan Fine Arts Institute.

In my free time, I like doing small art projects, like drawing and painting, I also enjoy working out, lifting weights as heavy as I can. I find great joy in pushing my limits and discovering new strengths.
